# Raspberry Pi headers

Java library with versions, types, headers and pins of all Raspberry Pi boards.

## Info

This library was created to auto-generate content for the book
[Getting started with Java on Raspberry Pi](https://leanpub.com/gettingstartedwithjavaontheraspberrypi/)
but can also be used in projects to define the Pi pins to be used as it gives you the different numbering
schemes used (pin number, wiring pi number).
